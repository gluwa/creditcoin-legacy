# Gluwa Creditcoin

## What is Creditcoin?

Creditcoin is a network that enables cross-blockchain credit transaction and credit history building. Creditcoin uses blockchain technology to ensure the objectivity of its credit transaction history: each transaction on the network is distributed and verified by the network.

The Creditcoin protocol was created by Gluwa. Gluwa Creditcoin is the official implementation of the Creditcoin protocol by Gluwa.

For more information, see https://creditcoin.org, or read the [original whitepaper](https://creditcoin.org/white-paper).

## Other Creditcoin Components

In order to facilitate modular updates, the Creditcoin components have been divided into several repos.

* This repo includes the Sawtooth 1.0.5 PoW consensus engine, Creditcoin Gateway, Creditcoin Processor, and Sawtooth REST API Hotfixes
* [Sawtooth-Core](https://github.com/gluwa/Sawtooth-Core) contains the Creditcoin fork of Sawtooth 1.2.x and is where most future development will take place
* [Creditcoin-Shared](https://github.com/gluwa/Creditcoin-Shared) has the CCCore, CCPlugin framework, and several plugins such as Bitcoin, ERC20, Ethereum and Ethless
* [Creditcoin-Client](https://github.com/gluwa/Creditcoin-Client) houses the command-line client for communicating with the Creditcoin blockchain

## Development Process
----------------------

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be completely stable.
Tags are created regularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Gluwa Creditcoin.


## Prerequisite for Windows

#### Boost 1.67.0 source

Place the source of boost 1.67.0 to `C:\local\boost_1_67_0`.

If you would like to use your own directory, you can change the setting in the project properties under
C/C++ => Generals => Additional Include Directories.

### Static Library 

Place the following `.lib` into `\SDK\lib\Debug` folder.  

#### Boost 1.67.0:

1. Download pre-built binaries for boost 1.67.0  

2. Take the following the `.libs` from the lib64-msvc-14.1 folder

    `libboost_chrono-vc141-mt-gd-x64-1_67.lib`  
`libboost_date_time-vc141-mt-gd-x64-1_67.lib`  
`libboost_regex-vc141-mt-gd-x64-1_67.lib`  
`libboost_system-vc141-mt-gd-x64-1_67.lib`  
`libboost_thread-vc141-mt-gd-x64-1_67.lib`


#### Cryptopp:

1. Download and install vcpkg


    `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git`  
    `vcpkg`  
    `cd vcpkg`  
    `bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`  


2. Install Cryptopp

    `.\vcpkg install cryptopp:x64-windows`
 
    The `.lib` file will be in vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\debug\lib\cryptopp-static.lib 


#### cpp-netlib 0.13.rc1:

1. clone cpp-netlib 0.13.rc1 from git branch release 0.13 

    `git submodule init`  
    `git submodule update`  

2. Follow the instruction on https://cpp-netlib.org/0.13.0/getting_started.html

    When calling cmake, use the following command instead:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \  
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc   \  
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ \  
      -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 \  
      ../cpp-netlib  
```

3. Edit CPP-NETLIB.sln

    In properties => C/C++ => Preprocessor => Preprocessor Definitions:

    Remove `WIN32` for x64 platform for the following projects:  
cppnetlib-client-connections  
cppnetlib-server-parsers  
cppnetlib-uri

    build above project with x64 platform, and take the `.lib` files


#### Sawtooth:

Follow the instructions in `\SDK\sawtooth.lib rebuild instructions.txt` to build the sawtooth.lib file
